[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/w25.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/w25) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/w25/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/w25)

This is a generic async driver for the W25 flash chips from Winbond.

Supported series:
- Q
- X

More series support is welcomed!

Defmt is also supported through the `defmt` feature.

This crate is adopted from <https://github.com/tweedegolf/w25q32jv>

## TODO

- Fast read support. So far there's only support for the normal read, so don't use a SPI speed of > 50Mhz

## Changelog
